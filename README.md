# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-
The project deals with developing a classification model that predicted the survival of the passengers onboard the Titanic Ship, keeping in mind various features included in the dataset.
Employed methods to clean data, impute missing data and worked on the EDA of the train data. Further worked on Feature Engineering to improve the model and evaluated the trained model using metrics like confusion matrix.
The model was based on XGBoost Algorithm.
